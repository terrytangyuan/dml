\usage{
rca(x, chunks)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix or data frame of original data.
Each row is a feature vector of a data instance.}

\item{chunks}{list of \code{k} numerical vectors.
Each vector represents a chunklet, the elements
in the vectors indicate where the samples locate
in \code{x}. See examples for more information.}
}
\value{
list of the RCA results:
\item{B}{The RCA suggested Mahalanobis matrix.
         Distances between data points x1, x2 should be
         computed by (x2 - x1)' * B * (x2 - x1)}
\item{A}{The RCA suggested transformation of the data.
         The data should be transformed by A * data}
\item{newX}{The data after the RCA transformation (A).
            newData = A * data}

The three returned argument are just different forms of the same output.
If one is interested in a Mahalanobis metric over the original data space,
the first argument is all she/he needs. If a transformation into another
space (where one can use the Euclidean metric) is preferred, the second
returned argument is sufficient. Using A and B is equivalent in the
following sense:

if y1 = A * x1, y2 = A * y2  then
(x2 - x1)' * B * (x2 - x1) = (y2 - y1)' * (y2 - y1)
}
\description{
Performs relevant component analysis on the given data.
}
\details{
The RCA function takes a data set and a set of positive constraints
as arguments and returns a linear transformation of the data space
into better representation, alternatively, a Mahalanobis metric
over the data space.

Relevant component analysis consists of three steps:
\enumerate{\item locate the test point
\item compute the distances between the test points
\item find \eqn{k} shortest distances and the bla}
The new representation is known to be optimal in an information
theoretic sense under a constraint of keeping equivalent data
points close to each other.

\note{
Note that any different sets of instances (chunklets),
      e.g. {1, 3, 7} and {4, 6}, might belong to the
      same class and might belong to different classes.
